-----READ ME----- 


THESE PROPS CAN BE USED FOR COMMERCIAL OR NON-COMMERCIAL RENDERS. BUT THEY ARE NOT TO BE SOLD OR PASSED OFF AS YOUR OWN WORK.




INSTRUCTIONS
============

After downloading the prop, I'd suggest you unzip it to a folder on your desktop.
In Daz Studio, go to FILE - IMPORT, then browse to the folder on your desktop, and
select 'elfin.OBJ'.

The IMPORT OPTIONS =

HEXAGON (1 UNIT = 1CM)

SCALE 100%


Daz Studio should load the prop and the materials/textures needed, if it does not do
so then in the SCENE TREE select 'Elfinaxe' and in the SURFACES TAB select 'elfinaxe', then 
scroll down and choose "bronze.jpg". Go to FILE - MERGE and look for 'BRONZE.JPG'. Do the 
same for the other parts which make up the axe.

Hopefully (I cannot promise anything) everything will work okay. Oh, I have given each
part it's own colour, but between you and me have a look in Rendo for 'Super-Shine-Shader'.

Happy rendering - John
